# DubHacks 2019

Our Idea:
To create an app or website that connects the homeless population in Seattle with Airbnb’s that are vacant and can be utilized as a place for shelter. The goal of this idea is to help reduce the homeless population in Seattle.
Potentially also having food at these locations provided by the hosts or previous tenants.
For the purpose of our project, we will be assuming that the Airbnb’s we use in our app/website are ones that allow homeless people to stay.

This report outlines the key findings of the 2014 Point-In-Time (PIT) and Housing Inventory (HIC) counts conducted in January 2014. Specifically, this report provides 2014 national, state, and CoC-level PIT and HIC estimates of homelessness, as well as estimates of chronically homeless persons, homeless veterans, and homeless children and youth.
Although the number of homeless people in WA has decreased from 2007 to 2014, we still want to provide a solution that keeps the number of homelessness in WA even lower. 4
