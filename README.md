# DubHacks 2019

Our Idea:
To create an app or website that connects the homeless population in Seattle with Airbnb’s that are vacant and can be utilized as a place for shelter. The goal of this idea is to help reduce the homeless population in Seattle.
Potentially also having food at these locations provided by the hosts or previous tenants.
For the purpose of our project, we will be assuming that the Airbnb’s we use in our app/website are ones that allow homeless people to stay.
